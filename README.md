# Learn Kotlin Projects

This repository contains the projects I am developing as part of the [Learn Kotlin](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-kotlin) course on Codecademy.

The projects here serve as practice and learning of Kotlin concepts covered in the course.

## Repository Structure

Each project or exercise from the course is organized into subdirectories. Each folder contains the source code related to the corresponding exercise or project.
